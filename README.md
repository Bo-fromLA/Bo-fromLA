- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bo-fromLA
- 👀 I’m interested in pushing my boundaries and testing my capacity to learn and execute things i've never done before :) I also want to network with software engineers and get to know more about the field itself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics and logic of coding, then would want to move to more of the full stack developing
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on multiple projects (will define more later as i progress)
- 📫 How to reach me - just knock at botagozu@gmail.com and feel free to say what you have in mind :) I'm pretty easy-going.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can teach you how to bachata :) I'm a certified teacher.
